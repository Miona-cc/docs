When customizing your messages in **Miona**, you may want to mention Discord roles, channels, or users. Discord uses a special formatting syntax for these mentions. Below is a full guide on how to use them inside your Miona message templates.

---

## 🧩 Mentioning Roles
To mention a role, use the following format:

```

<@&ROLE_ID>

```

Replace `ROLE_ID` with the actual ID of the role.

**Example:**
```

<@&123456789012345678>

```

---

## 📺 Mentioning Channels
To mention a channel, use:

```

<#CHANNEL_ID>

```

Replace `CHANNEL_ID` with the ID of the channel you want to reference.

**Example:**
```

<#987654321098765432>

```

---

## 👤 Mentioning Users
To mention a user directly, use:

```

<@USER_ID>

```

**Example:**
```

<@112233445566778899>

```

---

## 🔧 Dynamic Mentions (Using Miona Variables)
Miona supports dynamic variables that let you mention users involved in events without manually inserting their IDs.

You can use:

```

<@{member_id}>

```

or simply:

```

{member_mention}

```

These will automatically mention the relevant member when the message is sent.

This formatting works in both Discord messages and Miona's message builder, ensuring your bot sends clean, functional mentions every time.
