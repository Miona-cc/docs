Boost messages are special announcements sent whenever a member boosts your server. Miona allows you to create fully customizable boost messages, making it easy to celebrate and show appreciation for those who support your community.

💬 You can personalize these messages with text, images, or embeds, adding a unique touch to each boost. It's a great way to thank your boosters 🙌 and highlight their contribution, encouraging others to join in too!

<Note>
Boost messages require a `System Messages Channel` and the option `Send a message when someone boosts this server` enabled in your server settings.

This channel doesn’t need to be visible to everyone — only the bot must have permission to read messages in it.

## 🚀 How to Set It Up

First, create your boost message by using the following command:

```sh
/boost setmessage
```

Once you run this, the built-in editor will open so you can start customizing your message.

Use the buttons to update message properties. For example, click **Edit basic information** to modify the embed title, description, color, and more.

<Note>
Changes made in the built-in editor are saved automatically.

/boost setchannel <channel>

```sh
/boost test
