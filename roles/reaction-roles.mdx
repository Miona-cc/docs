**Reaction Roles** let you assign roles to members when they react to a specific message. It’s a great way to let users customize their experience or access different parts of your server—all with a simple emoji reaction.

This feature helps automate role management and encourages member engagement with minimal effort.

## ⚙️ Permissions Required
You must have the `Administrator` permission to use this command.

## ✨ Subcommands

### ➕ `/reactionroles add <message_url> <emoji> <role>`
Adds a reaction role to a message.

- `message_url`: Right-click the target message and "Copy Message Link"
- `emoji`: The emoji that will trigger the role assignment
- `role`: The role to assign when the emoji is used

**Example:**
```sh
/reactionroles add https://discord.com/channels/... 🔥 @Gamer
```

### ➖ `/reactionroles remove <message_url> <emoji>`
Removes a reaction role from a message.

**Example:**
```sh
/reactionroles remove https://discord.com/channels/... 🔥
```

### 📜 `/reactionroles list`
Lists all active reaction roles in your server.

## 🖱️ Quick Tip
You can also right-click a message, go to **Apps > Remove Reaction Role**, and remove it from there.

## 🧠 Notes
- The bot needs **Manage Roles** and **Read Message History** permissions in the target channel.
- Roles will only be given if the bot’s role is **above** the target role in the server role hierarchy.
- For help, use `/help` and look under the **Roles** category.
