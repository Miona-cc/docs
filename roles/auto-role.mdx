The **Auto Role** feature allows you to automatically assign roles to members as soon as they join your server. This helps with onboarding, access control, and organizing your community more efficiently.

You can configure separate roles for **users** and **bots**, ensuring each type gets the appropriate permissions right from the start.

## ‚ú® Subcommands

### ‚ûï `/autorole add <role> [bots]`
Adds a role to the auto-role list.

- `role`: The role to assign automatically.
- `bots` (optional): Set to `True` if the role should be assigned to bots only. Leave blank or `False` for regular members.

**Examples:**
```sh
/autorole add @Member
/autorole add @BotRole True
```

### ‚ûñ `/autorole remove <role>`
Removes a role from the auto-role list.

```sh
/autorole remove @Member
```

### üìú `/autorole list`
Lists all roles currently set for auto assignment. Roles assigned to bots will be shown with a `[Bots]` suffix.

## üß† Notes
- You can assign multiple roles for both users and bots.
- Auto Role works immediately when a user or bot joins your server.
- Ensure the bot has permission to assign the roles listed in your auto-role settings.
