The **Mass Role** command allows server administrators to quickly assign or remove a specific role from one member or multiple members at once. It's especially useful for managing large servers where manual role updates would be inefficient.

Whether you want to grant a role to everyone in a particular role or remove access from many users at once, this command simplifies the task.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Permissions Required
You must have the `Administrator` permission to use this command.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How to Use
To use the Mass Role command, simply type `/massrole` followed by the action you want to perform (add or remove), the target (user or role), and the role you want to assign or remove.
When you run the command for the first time you will be prompted to confirm your action.

When the action is finished, the bot will send a message in the channel where you ran the command.
