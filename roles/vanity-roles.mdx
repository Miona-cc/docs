**Vanity Roles** let you automatically assign roles to users who include your server’s invite link (like `discord.gg/miona`) in their custom status. It’s a powerful tool to reward those who help promote your community.

This feature helps boost visibility and encourages engagement through personalized recognition.

**Note:** This feature is **limited to 100 servers**. To get a slot, your server must meet the requirements and be manually approved.
