# ‚öôÔ∏è How to set it up?

To set it up you just need to run the following command:
```sh
/autopost automatch start <delay> [channel]
```

The `<delay>` argument is the delay between the pfps and it's required.
<Warning>
    The minimum `<delay>` is `1 minute` and if you want to decrease the delay please consider supporting us on our patreon store [here](https://patreon.com/MionaBot).

    Also there is a limit of `1` automatch channel per server, if you want to increase this limit please consider supporting us on our patreon store [here](https://patreon.com/MionaBot). 
</Warning>

After this step you need to choose the types of PFPs that you want the bot to send.

<Note>
You can select multiple image types for one channel.
</Note>

After setting up the autopfp, you might be asked to vote for the bot if you haven't already.
<Note>
The bot will ask you to vote every **48 hours**.

Servers with active `Premium` and `Platinum` subscriptions are not required to vote.

<Warning>
When you are voting, please use the link that is given to you by the bot or by running `/vote` in your server, because the link given by the bot is unique and identifies your server. This is the only way for us to know for which server you've voted.
</Warning>

After you've voted the bot should start sending matching PFPs of the desired types.
