**AutoMeme** is a feature that engages your community by sending fresh, random memes to a channel. It's a great way to spark fun and keep your community entertained!

## How to set it up?  

To set it up, just run the following command:  
```sh  
/automeme start <delay> [channel]  
```  

The `<delay>` argument specifies the delay between the memes and is required.  
<Warning>  
The minimum `<delay>` is `1 minute`. If you want to decrease the delay, please consider supporting us on our Patreon store [here](https://patreon.com/MionaBot).  

Additionally, there is a limit of `1` AutoMeme channel per server. To increase this limit, consider supporting us on our Patreon store [here](https://patreon.com/MionaBot).  
</Warning>  

After setting up AutoMeme, you might be asked to vote for the bot if you haven't already.  
<Note>  
The bot will ask you to vote every **48 hours**.  

Servers with active `Premium` and `Platinum` subscriptions are not required to vote.

<Warning>  
When you are voting, please use the link provided by the bot or by running `/vote` in your server. The link provided by the bot is unique and identifies your server. This is the only way for us to confirm your vote.  
</Warning>  

After you've voted, the bot will start sending fresh memes in your selected channel.  

## How to disable?  
You can disable AutoMeme by running the following command:  
```sh  
/automeme stop [channel]  
```  
If you don't specify a channel, the channel where you run the command will be used.  

## How to see your AutoMeme channels?
