Miona's ticket system is one of its most powerful features. It allows you to set up ticket panels with customizable [categories](/tickets/category), welcome messages, channel names, and more—all designed to match your server's unique style. With ticket panels, members can reach out for support, and you'll have a clean and structured way to assist them.

## 🛠️ How to Set Up a Panel

Start by creating a panel with the following command:

```sh
/tickets create-panel <name> <type>
```

<Note>
**Available Panel Types:**
- Panel with Select Menu (Dropdown)
- Panel with Buttons
- [Panel with Questions](/tickets/questions)

By default, you can create 1 panel. Upgrade to [premium](https://www.patreon.com/MionaBot) to create up to 3!
</Note>

Next, open the built-in panel editor:

```sh
/tickets edit-panel <name>
```

This will let you customize the embed, text, and style of your panel.

<Tip>
You can use [variables](/tickets/panel#what-variables-can-i-use) to personalize your messages.

Once you're done customizing your panel:

1. Add at least one [category](/tickets/category).
