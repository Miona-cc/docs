Tickets are one of Miona's most powerful features, letting you set up ticket panels with [categories](/tickets/category). Everything is fully customizable, from embeds to ticket channel names so you can create panels that match your servers style. With Miona Tickets, your members can easily contact you for support, and you will have an organized way to provide the help they need.

## How to set it up?

Firstly we need to create a panel, using the following command:
```sh
/tickets create-panel <name> <type>
```

<Warning>
You can create 1 ticket panel by default and can have up to 3 with [premium](https://www.patreon.com/MionaBot)!
</Warning>

Now lets edit our panel using the following command:
```sh
/tickets edit-panel <name>
```

Once you run this command the built-in editor will open and you can start editing your message.

<Tip>
Don't forget! You can always use the [variables](/tickets/panel#what-variables-can-i-use) when building messages.
</Tip>

<Note>
You may not be able to edit some of the message components such as footer. That requires [premium](https://www.patreon.com/MionaBot)!
</Note>

When you finished building your message **you must add at least one [category](/tickets/category) to the panel** and then use the following command to send your panel:
```sh
/tickets send-panel <name> <channel>
```
