This feature allows you to create ticket panels that include **custom questions** users must answer before a ticket is created. Their responses will be included in the initial ticket message, providing context right from the start.

## 🎛️ Creating a Panel with Questions

To begin, you'll need to create a **Panel with Questions**. Only this panel type supports adding custom questions.

```sh
/tickets create-panel <name> <type:Panel with questions>
```

Once created, you'll be prompted to:

- Choose a default category where the tickets will be created
- Add your custom questions

<Warning>
Each panel can contain **1 to 5 questions**. At least **1 question** is required for the panel to function.
</Warning>

</Frame>

When prompted for default category, you have up to **5 minutes** to select a category channel where ticket channels will be created.
If you don't select a category within this time, the panel will be automatically deleted.

## 📤 Sending the Panel to a Channel

After setting up your panel and questions, make sure to send the panel to a specific channel so users can interact with it:

```sh
/tickets send-panel <name> <channel>
```

<Note>
Need help sending your panel? Check out the [Panel Setup Guide](/tickets/panel) for detailed instructions.
