To set up a ticket panel with questions, you first need to create a `Panel with Questions`, as only this panel type supports questions.

```sh
/tickets create-panel <name> <type:Panel with questions>
```

After running the command above you will have to choose a default category for tickets to be created in, and add some questions.

<Warning>
A panel can have up to 5 questions, with at least 1 question required for the panel to function.
</Warning>

<Note>
After setting up your panel and its questions make sure to send your panel to a channel! Please take a look at [this guide](/tickets/panel) for more info. 

```sh
/tickets send-panel <name> <channel>
```

</Note>

You've successfully setup a panel with questions! Have a cup of tea.
