description: Create and assign ticket categories to panels for organized support.

Each ticket panel must have at least one assigned **category** to work properly. A category defines where the ticket channels will be created and helps keep your support system organized.

You can assign multiple categories to a single panel, giving users options to choose from when opening a ticket.
